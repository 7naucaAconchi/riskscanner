The facets property specifies the characteristics and limitations of the datatype that is being defined. It does this by imposing constraints on two aspects of the datatype: the Â·value spaceÂ· and the Â·lexical spaceÂ·. The Â·value spaceÂ· is the set of all possible values that the datatype can have. The Â·lexical spaceÂ· is the set of all possible Â·lexical representationsÂ· that can be used to express those values. The facets property ensures that all valid values and Â·lexical representationsÂ· of the datatype satisfy the constraints that are defined by the facets.
