Gulliver agrees to help Horatio and breaks free from his chains. He rescues Princess Mary from the Blefuscian invaders and puts out the fire in the palace. He is hailed as a hero by the Lilliputians and becomes a close friend of King Theodore. He also helps Horatio woo Princess Mary by teaching him how to play guitar and sing songs like \"Kiss\" by Prince and \"War\" by Edwin Starr.
 
Meanwhile, General Edward becomes jealous of Gulliver's popularity and plots to overthrow him. He steals his iPhone and contacts the Blefuscian leader, General Limtoc (James Corden), to arrange a secret meeting. He offers to help Limtoc kidnap Princess Mary and defeat Gulliver in exchange for power and glory. Limtoc agrees and sends a spy to Lilliput to sabotage Gulliver's ship.
 
Gulliver decides to write a false article about his adventures in Lilliput and send it to Darcy via email. He claims that he has discovered a new island called Brobdingnag, where he is revered as a god by giant people. He also embellishes his role in Lilliput's history and culture, making himself the inspiration for their inventions, arts, and sports. He hopes that Darcy will be impressed by his article and fall in love with him.
 
However, Darcy becomes suspicious of Gulliver's story and decides to travel to Bermuda to find him. She hires a boat captain named Benjamin (Romany Malco) to take her to the Bermuda Triangle. Along the way, they encounter a storm and a giant robot shark that attacks their boat. They manage to escape and reach Lilliput, where they are captured by General Edward's soldiers.
 
General Edward reveals his treachery to Gulliver and shows him Darcy as his prisoner. He challenges Gulliver to a duel using giant robots powered by steam. Gulliver accepts the challenge and fights Edward in a robot suit made by the Lilliputian engineers. The battle is fierce and destructive, but Gulliver manages to defeat Edward and rescue Darcy.
 
Gulliver apologizes to Darcy for lying to her and confesses his true feelings. Darcy forgives him and admits that she likes him too. They kiss and celebrate with the Lilliputians, who have also defeated the Blefuscian army with Gulliver's help. Gulliver decides to stay in Lilliput with Darcy as his girlfriend, Horatio as his best friend, and King Theodore as his mentor.
